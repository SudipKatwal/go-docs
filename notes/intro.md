# Golang Basics

## Introduction

Golang, or Go, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed by Google. It is known for its simplicity, performance, and concurrency support.

- Statically typed

  _Statically typed_ refers to a type system used in programming languages where variable types are explicitly declared and checked at compile time. This means that every variable and expression in the code must have a type that is known and verified before the program runs.

- Compiled programming language

  A _compiled programming language_ is a type of programming language where the source code written by the programmer is translated into machine code or a lower-level intermediate language by a compiler before it is executed by the computer.
